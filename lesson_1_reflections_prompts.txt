using diff to find bugs in two files.
eks: diff -u newestFile oldFile

using git diff to compare two commits
eks: git diff commitIdOne commitIdTwo
In order for the changes adding the mute button to be shown as additions, 
the commit with the mute button needs to be the second argument to git diff. 
That is because git diff considers the first argument as the "original", 
and the second argument as the "new" version, so additions are lines present in the second argument but not the first.

git clone

a commit should be made for every logical change. If a logical change can be broken down to smaller pieces it is better.
manual saving pros are that you dont unnessasery saving.
Cons are that you can forget savings.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because git is made for complex work where multiple files are dependet on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log command shows all the commits made. and git diff commands shows the differences between the commits.

git checkout

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I am more confident in making changes to code, because if anything breaks I can easyly go back to before it broke.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would use git for controlling the versions of my projects.

git diff: will do this. It takes two arguments - the two commit ids to compare.
git clone: will do this. It takes one argument - the url of the repository to copy.
git checkout: will do this. It takes one argument - the commit ID to restore.
git log: will do this. It doesn't take any arguments.

For copying a directory, you weren't expected to know this, but it is possible to copy 
a directory from one computer to another using the command scp, which stands for "secure copy". 
The name was chosen because the scp command lets you securely copy a directory from one computer to another.

git init: to add git to a directory.

git status: shows the files in the targeted directory

git add: is used to add files to the staging area. the staging area is the place to add files that should be
tracked and targeted by commits.
