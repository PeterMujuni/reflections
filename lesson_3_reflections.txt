When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate and share the code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In this way I controll what files to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks and Clones are some how the same, but are used in a defferent situation. I use Fork when I want to copy a repo from another github acount to my github acount.
And I use clone when I want to copy the repo from gitHub to my local machine. Branches are that which forks and clones operate on.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If I know that I will soon be without internet acces, I can fetch a copy of the remote repo. This helps me know what changes have been made 
by others at the time of fecthing the remote copy and I can keep on working even without internet connection.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
whenever making changes when collaborating with others, you should create branch and request for at pull, when wanting to add it to the master.
