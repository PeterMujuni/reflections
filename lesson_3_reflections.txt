When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate and share the code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In this way I controll what files to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks and Clones are some how the same, but are used in a defferent situation. I use Fork when I want to copy a repo from another github acount to my github acount.
And I use clone when I want to copy the repo from gitHub to my local machine. Branches are that which forks and clones operate on.
