What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
with git init I add git to the choosen directory, if I dont add git, I will not be
able to track changes with git in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where I choose the files to track. the value is that I can choose whatever file(s) to track.
